0,"Over-acting from every single idiotic character who all do idiotic things for reasons unfathomable to any normal functioning human on the face of the earth.
I couldn't handle more than 3 episodes of the first season. That is a chunk of my life I'll never get back!
Save yourself and avoid."
1,"Well, the writers and producers outdone themselves.
They started with a good idea, intriguing characters and an elaborate plot.
By the end of season 2 it became apparent they could not drag this anymore.
Season 3 was just a ""remake"" of season 1 but, my God, season 4 is an awful soap opera...seems almost like a ""filler"" season...no actual plot, no actual action...you could skip straight to episode 7 if u want and still..you wouldnt miss a thing.
Hire better writers, because this cast is impeccable."
2,"I really only write reviews when I feel like a show is getting way too much of praise or way too little.
I love heist movies/series. So it makes sense that I would finally end up watching this one. But let me warn you, other heist lovers, this is a soap opera not a heist story. I'm 6 episodes in now (probably wont be a 7th) and it's just annoying the hell out of me. The characters are unbelievably stupid, doing things that even people like us, who aren't actually career criminals, would never do. And what is the reason for this stupidity? LOVE! Or, maybe I should say crushes? Criminals loving criminals, criminals loving hostages and every other combination. These are people who have lost it all and want everything, and then drop the whole plan and do ridiculous thing when a girl/boy smiles at them sweetly.
I know that I'm very late to reviewing this thing (as it already has multiple seasons) but if my words can save someone 6 hours of their life, it will be worth it. I sadly won't be getting that time back.
it's a 2/10 stars for me (but I put 3/10 believing that people are more likely to ignore the very low score reviews, and I aim to protect you people) :D
Take care! :)"
3,The more u watch it.. the dumber it gets.. idea of the plot is good. Direction is just like a soap opera.
4,Too much relationship storyline. I just really wanted a heist show. The premise was awesome but diluted to become a soap opera with a heist backdrop. Too bad
5,"Well to be honest very disappointed in the season, I was waiting for this season since the end of season 3So we started the season inside the bank, ended inside the bank.. and what's the progress? Dead NairobiThat's about it, and I made my peace with Nairobi since last season dead, for some reason they decided to bring her back to life to kill her again at the end of this seasonPunch of hugs, cries and completely unnecessary past scenes that were extremely boringGandia standing in the middle of the hallway surrounded by 4 of them shooting automatic weapons and he still stand, breaks out of his cuffs and leave Rio as if he is going to a picnicSo if you look logically at the season, you gained absolutely nothing from 8 episodes, just unnecessary stretch filled with unnecessary events, scenes and past scenesAn idiot decided to help Gandia out the assassin! As if he didnt know how to break out of his cuffs alone! Then he is back in command again! Forgotten and forgiving! Coffin that would stop an assault! A police man that made no sense after jumping off the 4th storey building to agree to join them and giving them all the Intel they need! And a crazy detective who figures it all out from scenes that were put on repeat that she did not see!End of the day.. very disappointing, stretched out and unnecessary season where they could have ended the story there but yet to wait for another season ""maybe""In my opinion they could break lisbon out in the first 2 episodes, had the Gandia drama in 1 episode, dropped the bomb over few different episodes insead of cramping them in 1 and ended the story thereAnd what to expect next season? Another stretched out season to finish a series that could have easily be finished this season"
6,"The real heist is by the writers who keep stalling for more time with more nonsense episodes while Netflix prints money.First season had promise. But shortly into the season characters start making flatout preternatural connections especially inspector Raquel. Which she corrects by missing the most obvious ones. 6 episodes in... coming out of a hazy binge stupor because your wife keeps pressing next... you realize... wait... they expect us to believe all this happens in 3 days. People recover from gunshot wounds as if they were scratches. Of course, everyone forgives and forgets. Love stories happen when someones sneezes. Investigations are mobilized across all of Spain with such immediacy and the realtime forensics of our dreams. Then the typical ""we have the all important lab results - i knew he was the guy - but your voicemail is now full - and I'm the jaded drunk lover about to have an accident/coma routine - let me call your selectively Alzheimers mother."" If only his twin would show up.... Professor Palpatine's plan then everything would be proceeding as he's forseen. If we still had TV guide this show would be on at 11 am after ""the View."" I got fooled because they didn't shoot it in live camera format with dramatic face to face pauses, watery eyes, and breakaways to commercial (remember those). Music is pretty good. I can go on... but then I would be an accomplice perpetuating the real crime of taking your time with this show (like the writers!)Watch no more than two episodes to get the gist/hype then make your escape!"
7,"With a 100% positive critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes and with many of my friends going crazy for it, my opition might not be very popular. But I find La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) to be utterly ridiculous, overly melodramatic and just plain stupid."
8,"I had heard so many good things about this show. The most watched show in Europe, Spain's biggest ever viewing figures etc. Then from a promising start the program just gets more and more ridiculous. Now I know it's just apiece of entertaining fictional drama but half the skill in making a show like this is to get the audience to think as far fetched as the plot is a part of you would like to think it could be done.The show makes the perpetrators and the police look as stupid and as dumb as each other. You get robbers falling in love and having sex, robbers having sex with hostages and wait for it the mastermind behind the robbery having sex with the chief inspector in charge of the police operation. The plot has more holes than a second hand dart board. Only the production value and some good set pierces save this from one star. 3/10"
9,"Professor what are we robbing in season 3-4-5? Professor: People Will think we are robbing the bank of Spain, However wee are actually going to rob the viewers of their time, we will insult their intellect with every scene and episode, make them cringe and want to kill themselves with unnecessary gay drama, show them some of the most unrealistic action the world has seen. And that way we will rob them of their time. THE BIGGEST HEIST IN MANKID!!!!!"
10,"This series should have ended in season 2, season 3 and 4 totally unnecessary"
11,"A band of robbers, lead by a man known simply as 'the Professor', infiltrate and rob the Spanish National Mint. They appear to bungle it, ending up holed up in the Mint with 67 hostages. But it's all part of the Professor's plan. If it succeeds, they'll make off with over $2 billion Euros.Entertaining, initially, and could have been a masterpiece. The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing. It was also engaging: you got to know the individual characters of the heisters, as well as who they were up against. From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm. The dumb plot developments became predictable, eg you have a situation where a character has a choice and the logical thing, the thing people would do 100% of the time in real life, is to do A. However, A would mean the series ends, so the character does B, and the series continues.So the plot only makes sense if you're mind-bogglingly stupid.By the end I just wanted it to be over, so my intelligence would no longer be insulted. And yet it still got drawn out, by about 2-3 episodes too many.And apparently there's a Season 3 in the works. Considering how it ended, not sure how that's possible, but the producers did manage to turn what should have been a 8-or-so episode mini-series into a 2-season, 22-episode series."
12,"I really dont get it, what do these high ratings see in this series. This is the most dumbest heist i have ever seen. You plan something for years, you train people for months and then what? During the heist they fight among themselves? Forced soap opera level drama in a heist story. Dumbest series ever!"
13,"I've started watching this as the idea sounded interesting with quite some potential when seeing a series filmed in Europe. But, my God, the characters do loose touch with reality and common sense already during season one. By mid season two I could no longer see this. In all honesty, do we really have to have the ""bad guys"" completely useless when enforcing something, taking revenge or even facing each other? Do we really have all the women in this series falling flat on their backs, in love with the perps? And does the Spanish Police, in real life, act like this? Meaning...will an arrest happen when the perp surrenders as he gets bored from being caught 10x? Another soap opera that disappoints more by creating actually an expectation to get something different..."
14,"This series gives a lot of big messages.
First of all, Dali masks are not an ordinary choice. Dali is a genius painter who inherited life that is contrary to popular morality and common customs. He has never accepted the imperatives from the society and the right to wrong moral codes. The masks represent this irregularity.Red overalls represent socialism. The wearers are socialist comrades and fighting. Mint and cops represent capitalism. In capitalism money sets everything. Even morals will set money. So when someone attacks the money, those people are declared bad. When attacked by money, capitalism is waging a war against the attackers with its armed and visual mechanisms.The professor is symbolizing the scientific perspective and accounting. After all, scientific thinking and accountability overcome all kinds of problems. But love succumbs.I have not seen such meaningful socialism for a long time. Moreover, Salvador Dali's tactic was used in the series. You think you are watching the events, but every time you have a deep meaning and message. Ciao Bella is the symbol of socialism.Fabulous work. It's not just a movie or a script. It is a wonderful work as a philosophy. There is a great slap in the capitalist system. 10/10"
15,"It's rubbish. Period. The problem is that the show takes itself very seriously but ends up becoming a caricature of itself. I have no reservations towards mindless entertainment but the sheer audacity of the writers to pull anything off from their hat under the pretext of a mastermind professor for me, is ridiculous."
16,"I have never been more confused by a high rating for a show. Not a single part of it is well executed. The acting is not good, the writing is much much worse. None of the characters behave remotely like real people.... it's a mess. It's basically looney toons robbing a bank, but somehow very sad and excruciatingly boring."
17,"Is Spanish police/administration this dumb as shown in the series then 'god help them'.
From the logic behind the robbery that ""we are not stealing from people but just printing our own money"" is also one of the dumbest logic applied in the history of heist movies/series. Have they even heard of a word ""inflation""?.
I wasted my 10- 15 hrs watching season 1 and 2.
If you are a guy/girl who watches lot of quality movies/series then please don't waste you time on this."
18,"Season 1 and season 2 were 9/10 for me. However season 3 was meh and season 4 pretty meh except the two last episodes.Unfortunately, an other show netflix destroyed because of it's success.."
19,"This series got a high rating. So I thought let's check it out. My god how the hell people are even liking it! It is so overrated. Here are few points I picked up from first 7 episodes.
1) Professor makes the stealing looks like a heroic act. I mean how. They are not stealing but printing money, so what is that, charity!!!
2) The guys involved in the heist are so stupid. Two of them fell in love & now their love is more important than their mission. One father who spent most of his life in prison got panick attack knowing his son has murdered a hostage and almost compromised their mission. The son who is a 'hotshot' and used to 'bully people' fell in love with a hostage and could not kill her. (Yeah that's how the poor their writting is). It's nothing wrong for a criminal to have a heart but they have it too much, you will feel they are too good to be a criminal (but none of them are amateurs).
3) The police. They are the stupidest people I know. An inspector shares her mission information with her mother. She goes home & comes back like you are in a 9-5 job. She even dates during the mission. They let any people enter in their camp, no privacy at all. Even I could have fooled them.
Don't even talk about the acting and voice-overs. Apart from one or two people the acting is aweful. Please stay away from this show."
20,Seriously whats the fuss about??? The main characters start showing major flaws as soon as episode 3. Plot holes which make no sense. Silly actually!
21,"Season 1 and 2 were great and amazing, I'd say 9/10. But then Netflix saw a chance to make money and prolongued this show into 2 unnecessary seasons that completely ruined this show. I'm just sick and tired of this by Netflix. This last season was a disaster, filled with unrealistic stuff.
Stop before it's too late."
22,"Like everything in this generation, I discovered this TV show through hype. It was going viral, on my Netflix home screen, on twitter, everywhere. So, I decided to give it a try. I feel disappointed I wasted my time on this show. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows like Spiderman, Superman, Batman etc. Honey Heist is a mirror image of super hero movies, difference being the crew here is a bunch of bad guys. I'm not a fan of fantasy shows because of the imbalance, one side is extremely strong, smart, has all the powers available right on time and other side is simply dumb. In this show too, it's the same, the cops are dumb and incompetent. The cops in this show have all the equipment, fancy gears, intelligence power, yet they screw up worse than a third world country cops, not once but multiple times, come on, are the Spanish cops really that bad? Could the makers not make is somewhat believable? The Royal Mint of Spain is under siege and the top cop is going on a dinner date? Having an affair with the main accused? Oh my, that is some level of soap opera right there. And to top it off they dragged what could have been a mini-series to 4 seasons. Learned my lesson, don't jump on the hype wagon, do your research before wasting time on something like this again."
23,"This is a soap opera, looks like a smart tv show but it's a latin soap opera and you watch it like that(50% brain turned off, the logic part)"
24,"It really started okay, but was way drug out. Season 1 was clever. After that, the flashbacks became annoying. The characters became unlikable. How many times do you need to pull guns on each other? Season 3 was a confusing cartoon. Heist was stupid and really made no sense at all. Watch it if you have the extra time but its not better than a 5."
